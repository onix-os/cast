## Goal

Make a Stone recipe behave like a pure package declaration rather than a
manifest that Boulder completes through hidden Rust policy.

The target pipeline is:

```text
pure Gluon package factory
    -> concrete typed PackageSpec
    -> source, policy, and dependency resolution
    -> canonical DerivationPlan
    -> one or more .stone packages
```

The `.stone` file remains the package artifact. `DerivationPlan` is the
Nix-like build description and reproducibility boundary.

## Non-negotiable constraints

- Gluon is the only OS Tools configuration language.
- YAML and KDL support must be completely absent from owned configuration,
  including loaders, fallback paths, compatibility shims, dual writes, and
  documentation. YAML required by external services such as GitHub is not OS
  Tools configuration.
- `../bedrock` is outside this plan and must not be modified.
- Gluon evaluation remains pure and capability-restricted: no network,
  processes, host filesystem discovery, environment reads, or wall-clock time.
- Generated locks and plans are distinct from authored package modules.
- The final architecture must have one source of truth. Versioned migration
  code may exist while a phase is being implemented, but the old recipe ABI,
  macro language, and compatibility paths must be removed before completion.
- Work lands as small, reviewable commits. Each implementation slice below
  should normally be one commit, with tests committed beside the behavior.
  Commit after every few cohesive changes rather than accumulating an entire
  phase in the working tree.
- Use the repository Makefile for build, check, lint, and test operations.
- Do not use Python to edit repository files.
- Do not change release/version metadata or the `.stone` archive format as part
  of this work.

## Current foundation

- [x] `stone.glu` is executable Gluon rather than decoded data.
- [x] Recipes can import local modules, call functions, and update immutable
  records.
- [x] The evaluator restricts capabilities and applies resource limits.
- [x] Recipe source, imports, ABI modules, and explicit inputs participate in
  evaluation fingerprints.
- [x] Sources can be represented by an authored recipe plus a generated
  `sources.lock.glu`.
- [x] YAML and KDL configuration paths have been removed from OS Tools.

The public recipe boundary is now `boulder.package.v2`; the former
`boulder.recipe.v1` embedded module, encoder, evaluator, and fixtures have been
removed. Standard builders produce typed phase steps, and the planner can
resolve an exact package closure into `build.lock.glu`, freeze a canonical
`DerivationPlan`, and explain its derivation ID.

The normal build path now plans first and carries the validated
`DerivationPlan` through exact root installation, locked-source materialization,
the isolated container, phase execution, package analysis and collection,
manifest verification, artifact emission, and plan-owned cleanup. It records
the plan's derivation ID rather than synthesizing an identity from runtime
state.

The remaining problem is the pre-freeze transitional model. Planning still
uses the internal `Recipe` domain and macro definitions to construct resolved
steps and environment before freezing them into the plan.

### Current blockers

- `PackageSpec` still lowers into the internal `Recipe`/`RecipeSpec` domain for
  pre-freeze planning. That Rust representation is not a public Gluon ABI, but
  it remains a transitional second model.
- `bin/boulder/src/build/job/phase.rs` resolves standard builders from typed
  `StepSpec` values, but `Shell` steps and builder environment definitions
  still pass through `stone_recipe::script`. `%action` is allowed only through
  the explicit shell escape hatch; `%(definition)` removal awaits typed path,
  toolchain, tuning, and environment values during planning.
- Mutable local `%(pkgdir)` inputs are rejected before freeze. Supporting them
  requires a local-source ABI which hashes their content and destination into
  the derivation rather than exposing an untracked recipe-directory mount.
- Configured policy layers beyond the explicit repository policy root remain
  deferred until their order and provenance are part of `recipe explain` and
  derivation identity.

## Target semantics

### Package factories

The documented authoring unit will be a pure Gluon function:

```text
PackageInputs -> PackageSpec
```

`PackageInputs` contains only explicit, immutable values such as dependency
references, platform information, selected features, and builder functions.
The package factory is called inside Gluon; Rust receives a concrete DTO, not
a VM closure.

The current ABI expresses that contract directly:

```gluon
// package.glu
let b = import! boulder.package.v2
let cmake = import! boulder.builders.cmake.v1

\deps ->
    let base = b.mk_package (b.meta {
        pname = "hello",
        version = "1.0.0",
        release = 1,
        homepage = "https://example.invalid/hello",
        license = ["MIT"],
    })
    {
        sources = [
            b.source.archive
                "https://example.invalid/hello-1.0.0.tar.xz"
                "sha256-hex",
        ],
        native_build_inputs = [deps.pkgconf],
        build_inputs = [deps.zlib],
        builder = cmake.builder {
            flags = ["-DBUILD_TESTS=ON"],
            .. cmake.defaults
        },
        .. base
    }
```

The root explicitly supplies the scope:

```gluon
let make = import! "./package.glu"
let pkgs = import! "./package-set.glu"

make {
    pkgconf = pkgs.pkgconf,
    zlib = pkgs.zlib,
}
```

There is no automatic argument-name reflection in the first implementation.
Explicit records preserve Gluon's type checking and make missing dependencies
visible.

### Three specification layers

1. **`PackageSpec`** records authored package intent: metadata, sources,
   symbolic inputs, builder selection, hooks, outputs, and package rules.
2. **`PolicySpec`** records explicit repository policy: platforms, toolchains,
   builders, tuning, environment, and package templates.
3. **`DerivationPlan`** is the fully resolved, target-specific, canonical data
   consumed by the executor.

The executor must not discover dependencies, reload policies, infer builder
tools, or mutate package outputs after `DerivationPlan` has been frozen.

### Typed package relations

Dependencies must become typed values rather than unvalidated strings:

```gluon
b.dep.package "zlib"
b.dep.binary "cmake"
b.dep.pkgconfig "openssl"
b.dep.soname "libz.so.1"
b.dep.output (b.package_ref "zlib") "dev"
```

The first implementation may lower these variants into the current provider
syntax. The final implementation must share one dependency representation
between Boulder and Moss rather than maintaining separate parsers.

Inputs are separated by purpose:

- `native_build_inputs`: programs executed by the builder;
- `build_inputs`: libraries and headers used for the target output;
- `check_inputs`: dependencies needed only by checks;
- output-specific runtime dependencies.

The data model must leave room for build, host, and target platform roles
without making cross compilation implicit.

### Structured builders and hooks

Build systems become pure Gluon modules such as:

```text
boulder.builders.cmake.v1
boulder.builders.meson.v1
boulder.builders.cargo.v1
boulder.builders.autotools.v1
```

A builder returns structural data containing its tools, environment, phases,
and hooks. Boulder must not learn that CMake or Ninja is required by expanding
a `%cmake` string.

Standard builders should expose typed configuration and pre/post hooks. A
deliberate `custom` or `shell` escape hatch remains available; declarative
construction requires explicit inputs and effects, not the elimination of
shell commands.

### Overrides and policy composition

Two different operations remain explicit:

1. **Package argument override:** call a package factory with a different
   dependency, feature, builder, or platform value.
2. **Typed attribute override:** transform an already produced `PackageSpec`
   through a total `PackagePatch`.

Patch operations use strict semantics:

```text
Keep
Set value
Replace values
Prepend values
Append values
```

Policy composition initially uses ordered one-way transformations:

```text
PolicySpec -> PolicySpec
```

Policy maps use explicit `add`, `replace`, and `modify` operations. Duplicate
unqualified additions are errors. Recursive Nix-style `final: prev:` fixed
points are deferred until a concrete requirement justifies their additional
cycle and diagnostic complexity.

### Frozen derivation plan

`DerivationPlan` must include every input that can change the build:

- schema version and Boulder implementation version;
- recipe and imported-module fingerprints;
- locked sources and source-lock digest;
- exact Moss-resolved package and output identities;
- build, host, and target platform values;
- selected policy, profile, toolchain, and builder fingerprints;
- all resolved phases, hooks, arguments, and environment values;
- networking, cache, PGO, emulation, and tuning choices;
- package outputs and path-selection rules;
- the chosen reproducible source timestamp.

Canonical encoding produces the identity:

```text
derivation_id = hash(canonical_encode(DerivationPlan))
```

Every emitted Stone and manifest records this ID. Stone payload hashes remain
output-integrity checks; they do not replace the derivation identity.

## Implementation phases

### Phase 1: Freeze the contracts

- [x] Document `PackageSpec`, `PolicySpec`, and `DerivationPlan` ownership and
  invariants in the code that will own them.
- [x] Inventory every value Boulder currently adds after recipe evaluation.
- [x] Classify each value as authored intent, repository policy, resolved
  dependency, executor-only state, or forbidden ambient state.
- [x] Add regression tests proving that the same explicit inputs evaluate to
  the same result and fingerprint.
- [x] Rework or remove breakpoint source-line recovery that still assumes
  legacy YAML block syntax.

**Exit gate:** every current hidden input has an assigned destination in one
of the three specification layers.

### Phase 2: Make policy explicit

- [x] Create one Gluon policy root that explicitly declares the base policy,
  actions, architecture definitions, tuning, and package templates; bind every
  declared module fingerprint into the root fingerprint.
- [x] Replace directory enumeration and filesystem-order merging in
  `Macros::load` with evaluation of that root.
- [x] Implement strict `add`, `replace`, and `modify` composition.
- [x] Retain and propagate policy and profile fingerprints.
- [x] Include selected target and policy inputs in evaluation provenance.
- [x] Add diagnostics showing which module introduced or modified a policy
  value.

**Exit gate:** policy order is visible in Gluon, duplicate semantics are
explicit, and no macro/profile fingerprint is discarded.

### Phase 3: Introduce `boulder.package.v2`

- [x] Add the versioned `PackageSpec` ABI without changing the executor yet.
- [x] Establish `PackageInputs -> PackageSpec` as the package authoring
  convention.
- [x] Add defaults and a complete typed patch algebra covering every field.
- [x] Lower v2 deterministically into the current validated recipe/domain
  model.
- [x] Add imported-package, dependency-override, attribute-override, and error
  diagnostic examples.
- [x] Add an evaluation command that prints the concrete normalized
  `PackageSpec`.

**Exit gate:** real fixtures are authored as package factories and Rust only
receives concrete, validated package data.

### Phase 4: Type dependencies and outputs

- [x] Introduce `DependencySpec`, `PackageRef`, and `OutputRef` variants.
- [x] Separate native build, target build, check, and runtime relations.
- [x] Move the canonical provider parser and representation into a shared
  crate used by both Boulder and Moss.
- [x] Make root and split outputs explicit in `PackageSpec`.
- [x] Detect missing references, duplicate output names, and dependency cycles
  before execution.
- [x] Remove duplicated shallow dependency-string validation in favor of the
  shared canonical relation parser.

**Exit gate:** no package relationship depends on an opaque, independently
validated recipe string.

### Phase 5: Add structured builders

- [x] Implement CMake, Meson, Cargo, and Autotools builder modules.
- [x] Make each builder return its required tools, environment, phases, and
  supported hooks.
- [x] Initially lower structured builders into the current shell pipeline.
- [x] Preserve an explicit custom builder for packages outside standard build
  systems.
- [x] Add equivalence tests against representative existing macro-driven
  recipes.

**Exit gate:** standard recipes do not use `%action` strings and their build
dependencies are structural.

### Phase 6: Normalize and freeze `DerivationPlan`

- [x] Resolve sources, dependencies, target, policy, builder, profile, and
  reproducibility inputs into one canonical plan.
- [x] Add generated `build.lock.glu` data for the exact package/output closure,
  base build state, repository snapshot, toolchain, target, and policy
  identities.
- [x] Wire `build.lock.glu` into Boulder planning with explicit missing, stale, and
  update behavior.
- [x] Keep authored package modules separate from `sources.lock.glu` and
  `build.lock.glu`; Gluon evaluation describes requests while Rust performs and
  freezes I/O-backed resolution.
- [x] Eliminate wall-clock and Git fallback; plan creation requires an
  explicitly selected timestamp and records it in the plan.
- [x] Implement stable canonical encoding and derivation hashing.
- [x] Add `boulder recipe plan` and `boulder recipe explain` commands.
- [x] Add derivation-ID fields to JSON manifests, binary manifest metadata, and
  Stone metadata, and supply the validated ID during frozen-plan emission.
- [x] Change the build executor to consume only the frozen plan. Normal builds
  require explicit target and source timestamp inputs, require or update
  `build.lock.glu`, exact-install its package closure, materialize only locked
  sources, execute with `exec_frozen`, package through `FrozenPackager`, verify
  manifests on the host, and clean only plan-owned paths.
- [x] Prove that changing any source, dependency, target, policy, builder,
  phase, environment, output, or timestamp changes the derivation ID.

**Exit gate:** after plan creation, Boulder performs execution but no semantic
composition.

### Phase 7: Package scopes and controlled policy layers

Scopes are ordinary, nonrecursive imported Gluon records passed to factories:
missing fields are Gluon type errors, local output cycles fail before planning,
and Moss closure cycles report their exact dependency path. No hidden recursive
scope graph or Rust `PackageSet` ABI is implied.

- [x] Add explicit reusable dependency scopes backed by Moss provider
  resolution.
- [x] Support ordinary Gluon package-argument overrides.
- [x] Support typed whole-package patches analogous to attribute overrides.
- [ ] Allow configured, ordered policy layers only when they are visible in
  `recipe explain` and included in the derivation identity.
- [x] Detect missing scope entries and cycles with actionable diagnostics.

**Exit gate:** packages are reusable functions without creating a second
recursive package universe inside Gluon.

### Phase 8: Retire the transitional model

- [x] Replace phase strings with typed `StepSpec` sequences for standard
  builders where structural steps are possible.
- [ ] Remove `%action` and `%(definition)` parsing after golden parity tests.
- [x] Remove filesystem-discovered macro composition.
- [x] Remove the public `boulder.recipe.v1` ABI, its standalone encoders and
  evaluator, and migrate all tracked recipes and fixtures to package v2.
- [ ] Remove the internal `Recipe`/`RecipeSpec` lowering once the executor and
  packaging path consume `PackageSpec` and `DerivationPlan` directly.
- [ ] Remove obsolete defaults and duplicated Rust/Gluon wire definitions.
- [x] Audit the repository for YAML/KDL loaders, fallbacks, compatibility
  paths, examples, and documentation. The only owned YAML files are the
  external GitHub interfaces under `.github/`; negative tests and historical
  migration documentation are intentional text-only references. The Makefile
  `config-formats` gate rejects any tracked YAML/KDL path outside the exact
  external-service allowlist.
- [x] Update the Gluon configuration contract and package-authoring guide.

**Exit gate:** only the package-function ABI, explicit Gluon policy, and frozen
plan model remain.

## Validation gates

Every phase must add focused tests and finish with the relevant Make targets.
Before merging a phase:

```sh
make check
make test
```

The final architecture must demonstrate:

- identical explicit inputs produce byte-identical canonical plans and equal
  derivation IDs;
- source, dependency, target, builder, policy, profile, and environment
  changes invalidate the derivation ID;
- evaluator code cannot access the network, process environment, arbitrary
  host paths, processes, or time;
- the executor cannot add undeclared packages or policy after plan freezing;
- package overrides and policy composition have deterministic precedence;
- standard builders declare all tools structurally;
- generated plans explain the provenance of every resolved input;
- no OS Tools YAML/KDL compatibility path remains;
- existing `.stone` reading and package-management behavior remains covered by
  regression tests.

## Explicit non-goals

- Reimplementing the Nix language or Nix store.
- Building a lazy recursive Nixpkgs clone inside Gluon.
- Automatic `callPackage` argument-name reflection in the initial design.
- Evaluation-time fetching or import-from-derivation.
- Unrestricted global overlays or user-home policy discovery.
- Removing Moss provider resolution in favor of a second dependency solver.
- Eliminating all shell execution.
- Changing workspace release/version metadata or the `.stone` archive format.
- Modifying or migrating `../bedrock`.

## Completion definition

This plan is complete when a Stone package is authored as a reusable pure
Gluon function, all policy and package relationships are typed and explicit, a
canonical target-specific `DerivationPlan` fully describes the build before it
runs, Boulder executes only that plan, and no YAML, KDL, legacy recipe, or
macro compatibility path remains.
